## Nothing interesting to see here

Just a messy collection of practice docs to keep track of my Anki quizzing, scratch pads, etc.

Don't judge this chaos! I want to stay fresh! Even on the basics (and some of the stuff in here is going to be super basic). I'm usually much more organized.

Please check out my [GitHub Profile Page](https://github.com/mackwick) for pinned repos for nicer work. :)
